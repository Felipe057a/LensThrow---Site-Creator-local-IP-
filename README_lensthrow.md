# LensThrow â€” Local HTTP Server with Tkinter GUI

## Overview

**LensThrow** is a Python application featuring a modern dark-themed Tkinter GUI that enables you to create and publish local HTTP websites instantly on your network. It allows you to write and edit HTML, CSS, JavaScript (saved as `.java`), and Python scripts which can be served via a simple embedded HTTP server.

This project was created by **CDIMDET** to provide a lightweight, easy-to-use local web server interface with embedded code editing and quick deployment features.

## Important Security Warning

- The application executes the Python code you write using `exec()`. This means any Python code typed in can affect your computer directly, including modifying files, accessing the network, or other system operations.
- **Use extreme caution when running or sharing code via this tool.**
- This software is provided **"as is"** without any warranties. CDIMDET is **not responsible** for any damage or loss caused by usage.
- Only run code you trust or understand fully.
- The public server runs on your local network only, but be mindful of your network security.
